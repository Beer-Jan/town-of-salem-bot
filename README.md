# town-of-salem-bot
Discord bot allowing to automate certain parts of Town of Salem 1 to allow the game to be played through discord!

This bot does not have the medium. Any functions that this bot doesn't have can easily be controlled manually by an administrator or "gamemaster".
This code is made to work with a bot that anyone creates on one server, it cannot work on multiple servers at a time. Howerver, you can easily create multiple bots to run it on multiple servers.
The only things that you need to do is to change the variable names up the top for YES_REACTION_NAME and ALIVE_ROLE_NAME to fit whatever you use on your server, otherwise it can work on any server.
